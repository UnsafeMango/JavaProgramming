##Part 1
-Modify the program so that it uses a BufferedReader to read in the locations data

-Run the program to test it before moving to Part 2

##Part 2
-Modify the main method of the Locations class that it uses a BufferedWriter to write the data

-Open the locations.txt and directions.txt files to check that the data has been written successfully

-You will then need to make another change to the program to allow for the 0 (Quit) exits before using the newly created
    keys

-Hint: You may want to change the three instances of HashMap to LinkedHashMap in the Location Class and the one instance
    in the Locations Class so that you can compare the files more easily
